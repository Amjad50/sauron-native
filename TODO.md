# TODO
- [X] Calculate layouts for TUI backend using stretch
- Idea: Use raqote to render svg into BGRA
	- [X] then convert it to rgba then use it in nwg bitmap
	- [ ] Use image crate to convert image to platform specific format: gtk
- [ ] refine the events, should be similar to sauron

- Nwg backend
   - [ ] deal with nwg, flexboxlayout can not be nestabled
   - [ ] events need to propagate
